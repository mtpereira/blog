Hi there! My name's Manuel Tiago Pereira and I'm a Software Engineer passionate about systems automation and delivering production-ready applications. I've been around GNU/Linux systems since 2004 and, as of late, I've been dedicating my focus on how to enable the development of resilient applications on dynamic deployment environments.

When I'm not breaking IT stuff, I'm listening to music, playing card/board games,
cycling, running or practicing Aikido.
